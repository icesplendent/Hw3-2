# Hw3-2

## Implementation

    - connect the port
    - send mode and value to specific slave with `slave_address`
    - double check what slave had received from master
    - reply to master at slave
    - check the value received from slave at master.

## Results

    - mode = 1, slave returns value + 1
    - mode = 2, slave returns value + 2
    - else, slave returns value
